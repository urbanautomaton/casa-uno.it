## About your hosts

Scottish-Italian couple Alison and Pino have made their home in Le
Marche for the last 10 years, swapping the bustle of Milan for fields of
sunflowers and the azure Adriatic. Renovating a traditional farmhouse,
they have created a home full of art surrounded by a flourishing garden
where the two friendly dogs, Charlie and Ina, roam. Textile artist
Alison has her studio in the attic but extends her artistry to the
kitchen. You'll find homemade jam on the breakfast table, often made
from the plums, peaches and apricots from the garden, along with freshly
baked bread. 

Pino and Alison and immersed themselves in the local communities of San
Costanzo and Fano and can recommend the best nearby eateries, sights and
activities.
