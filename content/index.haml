  A warm welcome awaits you in this beautiful art-filled B&B in the heart of
  Le Marche.

  Set amid rolling hills, Casa Uno is a beautifully renovated farmhouse
  offering unique accomodation for individuals, couples or groups of up to 9
  people. Each of the timber-ceilinged rooms has its own modern en suite.
  There are 2 double bedrooms, 1 twin,  and 1 room with a double bed and a
  single bed. Your host, Alison, has brought her artist's eye to the
  decoration of the whole house, which is full of wonderful art and textiles.
  A delicious breakfast, with homemade bread and jam and fresh seasonal fruit
  is included.

  Casa Uno is the perfect base for exploring Le Marche and discovering its
  treasures: scenic, cultural and gastronomic.
